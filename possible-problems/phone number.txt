Given a string S, consisting of digits from 0 to 9, and a die with 10 faces each containing one digit from 0 to 9. 
We perform the following two-steps operation until the string becomes empty:
    1. Roll the die. Let the outcome be x.
    2. If x equals the first digit of the string, delete it. Otherwise, do nothing.
Calculate the expected number of times we perform the operation.


/*
can be made more fun by making up a story about a dude who wants to call a number,
but instead of entering the digits one by one, he presses a random digit on the keypad,
and if the digit doesnt match the corresponding digit of the number he deletes it and tries again
